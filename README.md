## Work Experience
**Consultant, Model Risk Management @ Deloitte (_August 2022- August 2023_)**
- Contributed to the end-to-end validation of a logistic regression-based credit scorecard model for a major Australian bank, assessing statistical methodology, model performance, and regulatory compliance, strengthening its precision and efficacy in risk management
- Facilitated the validation of a FICO Small Business Scoring Service model for a major American bank, aiding its integration into the business credit cards portfolio and providing key analytical insights that contributed to improved model building and use practices
- Evaluated model performance using statistical accuracy metrics, discrimination measures, and stability analysis, effectively mitigating model risks to surpass regulatory expectations and industry standards
- Developed a comprehensive report based on regulator’s guidelines, identifying actionable improvements in model design, performance, and governance, leading to strategic refinement of client operations

**Research Assistant @ Gokhale Institute of Politics and Economics (_June 2021- Jan 2022_)**
- Conducted data exploration and sanitization for the Food-Water-Energy Nexus project, used Python for data scraping and transformation, which facilitated critical environmental research

## Projects
### Bayesian Hierachical Approach to Modelling Financial Inclusion in Emerging Economies [Code](https://github.com/gnewatia/Financial-Inclusion-Prediction/blob/main/STA2201_finalreport.Rmd)

Using the World Bank Financial Inclusion Database as well as World Development Indicators and Financial Access Survey, we investigate individual level variables and country level variables that impact financial inclusion in Emerging Market Economies; using Bank Account Ownership as as our proxy to measure financial inclusion. Account Ownership is modelled as a binary variable using a Bayesian Hierarchichal Logistic Regression Model. The findings of the report illustrate a significant relationship between demographics and income of an individual in influencing account ownership. We model the variations in country via several macroeconomic and geographical outreach indicators and find differences among emerging markets. We also show that interaction with female and other individual level indicators is an important source to account for financial inclusion in the emerging markets. Ultimately, the model can be used to make better policies that foster financial inclusion so that emerging economies focus not only on economic prosperity but also the overall development of its’ population.

### Who makes 100K+ in Toronto? An Evidence from September 2023 Labour Force Survey Dataset [Code](https://github.com/gnewatia/Toronto-Wages-Modelling/blob/main/Toronto%20Wage%20Modelling.Rmd)

To address the problem of interest of classifying the individuals as High/Non-High Earners as well as determine the impact of their demographic characteristics on their classification, three kinds of models were developed and were compared based on their predictive and explanatory power. To create an explanatory model, full dataset was used to prevent bias into the model.These
models were validated for their explanatory power via the LRT that indicated that complex models (models with interaction effects) were a better fit compared to the nested model. The same models were then created for the purpose of prediction, but this time, the dataset was split into train(80% data) and test(20% data) for the purpose of assessing their generalization abilities. In this case, on the train data, 10 fold repeated cross validation was done to ensure the robustness and reliability of the model’s performance estimates. By repeatedly dividing the data into 10 different subsets of the train data and using each subset in turn for validation while training on the remaining data, we were able to mitigate the risk of overfitting and gain a more accurate understanding of how the model is likely to perform on unseen data. We then test these models on the test data and observe the Brier Score, our main metric to assess predictive power. In this case, we observe that Brier Score for Model 1 is lower than that for Model 2 and Model 3, which leads us to the conclusion that for the purpose of prediction, a less complex and a parsimonious model like Model 1 can give us better results. Overall, based on regression results, it was shown that the odds of being a high earner are higher for a male than for females, similarly, natives (non-immigrants) have higher odds of being high earners in Toronto compared to immigrants. Also, there is evidence of public sector wage premium in Toronto. These insights are therefore relevant from policy point of view as they highlight critical areas where interventions might be necessary to address wage disparities
